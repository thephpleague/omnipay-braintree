[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements Braintree support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```
composer require omnipay/braintree:"~4.0@dev"
```

For PHP versions 5.3 to 7.1.x
```
composer require omnipay/braintree:"~3.0@dev"
```

## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* Braintree

You need to set your `merchantId`, `publicKey` and `privateKey`. Setting `testMode` to true will use the `sandbox` environment.

This gateway supports purchase through a token (payment nonce) only. You can generate a clientToken for Javascript:

```php
$clientToken = $gateway->clientToken()->send()->getToken();
```
The generated token will come in handy when using the Javascript SDK to display the [Drop-in Payment UI](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/drop-in/javascript/v2) or [hosted fields](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/hosted-fields/setup-and-integration/javascript/v2) used to collect payment method information.

On successful submission of the payment form, a one-time-use token that references a payment method provided by your customer, such as a credit card or PayPal account is dynamically added to the form as the value of a hidden `payment_method_nonce` input field.

Use the `payment_method_nonce` to process your customer order like so:


```php
$response = $gateway->purchase([
            'amount' => '10.00',
            'token' => $_POST['payment_method_nonce']
        ])->send();
```

repository.
